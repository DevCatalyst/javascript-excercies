## Why Javascript?
With every action a user takes, Javascript can listen and track what happened or return new content. Just about anything you have in mind.

Javascript is everywhere on the web. For example, Javascript can be found in [dropdown menus](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#dropdowns), [tabs](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#tabs), or [modals](http://getbootstrap.com/javascript/#modals).

This is how you add magic to your websites and applications.
